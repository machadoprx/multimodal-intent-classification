# Multimodal intent classification with incomplete modalities using text embedding propagation

Determining the authorâ€™s intent in a social media post is a challeng-ing multimodal task and requires identifying complex relationshipsbetween image and text in the post. For example, the post imagecan represent an object, person, product, or company, while thetext can be an ironic message about the image content. Similarly, atext can be a news headline, while the image represents a provoca-tion, meme, or satire about the news. Existing approaches proposeintent classification techniques combining both modalities. However, some posts may have missing textual annotations. Hence, we investigate a graph-based approach that propagates available textembedding data from complete multimodal posts to incompleteones. This paper presents a text embedding propagation method,which transfers embeddings from BERT neural language modelsto image-only posts (i.e., posts with incomplete modality) considering the topology of a graph constructed from both visual andtextual modalities available during the training step. By using this inference approach, our method provides competitive results whentextual modality is available at different completeness levels, evencompared to reference methods that require complete modalities.

### Getting the Intent dataset

The provided text embeddings were obtained from a fine-tuned model for the problem, based on: https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased

```
$ git clone https://github.com/karansikka1/documentIntent_emnlp19/ ./dataset/
$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/pp1nkipzklrgqwl/paper-intent.zip
$ tar -xvf ./dataset/resnet18_feat.tar
$ unzip paper-intent.zip -d ./features
```

### Running the method for Intent classification

Requirements:

```
sklearn == 0.24.*
numpy == 1.21.*
pandas == 1.3.*
```

Running after dataset extraction, as explained above:

```
$ python3 run.py
```
